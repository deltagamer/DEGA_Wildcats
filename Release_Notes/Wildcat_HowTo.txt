DEGA Wildcat v1.2.0.0 How to use Advanced Features



Wildcats Hellfires

1 - AGM-114L Longbow Hellfire Anti-Tank (Radar guided, well, more like IR guided) Fire and Forget.

2 - AGM-114N Thermobaric Warhead (Laser Guided).


Static Line Parachutes

In order to use the static line parachutes you must consider the following: 

1:- The Helicopters terrain altitude must be above 140 Meters.
2:- Left or Right side door must be open
3:- The Player must be in any of the Cargo seats (this includes ffv crew positions)

If done correctly all players in the cargo seat will see a Blue action near the bottom of 
the action menu called 'Static Line Paradrop' This will eject the player with a T10 Parachute
and safely land them keeping all of their gear and any backpacks they had equipped.
